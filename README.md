# Fluff Animate
This is a fork off of GoAnimate Wrapper that's meant to run on the web. Although this is only for personal use (for now). Very little has actually been changed for now.
## How to Use
You can use it locally or on a website. To install this locally though, install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) then clone/download GoAnimate Wrapper (or this project but why would you bother).	Once done, unzip the folder, copy the path, and execute the following commands in your command prompt (where `{PATH}` is the folder path you copied):
```console
cd "{PATH}\GoAnimate-Wrapper-master"
npm install
npm start
```
**When done, go to your web browser and navigate to `localhost`.**
